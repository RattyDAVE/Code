 - "Big" - hours, minutes and seconds are displayed on the whole screen, in many different fonts. If you press the "Set" button while the last (third) binary clock is displayed all fonts will be displayed in a circular fashion.
 - "UTC" (universal time), useful for radio amateurs;
 - "Score" - allows keeping the game's score between two players, between 0 and 99.

7. Clock settings (options)
   Beside the current time, Wise Clock 3 can also display:
 - current date, formatted as "Month Day, Year"; this setting is enabled/disabled through the "DATE+"/"DATE-" menu options. 
 - temperature, in Celsius or Fahrenheit; this setting is enabled/disabled through the "TEMP+"/"TEMP-" and CELC/FAHR menu options.
 - one out of ten personalized, user-editable message, read from message.txt file on the SD card (e.g. "Happy Birthday dear John"). 
   This setting is enabled/disabled through the "MESG+"/"MESG-" menu options, followed by selecting one of the ten messages, M1, M2, M3 etc..

8. Set up the alarm time
   Alarm time can set through the menu option "ALARM".
   Press "Menu" button until you reach this option, then press "Set".
   From here on, the process is the same as setting up the time (point 2 above).
   When alarm time is set and the alarm is active/enabled, the hours and minutes are separated by a dot, e.g. 15.43.
   If the alarm is disabled, a colon is used to separate the two, e.g. 15:43.
   In most display modes the colon/dot alternate each second.
   With the alarm enabled it alternates colon/dot.
   With the alarm disabled it alternates colon/blank.
   Another alarm-related feature: 3 hours before the alarm goes off, the time is displayed in orange, 2 hours before the alarm goes off in red; otherwise, time is shown in green.

9. Enable/disable the alarm
   The alarm is activated (will sound) only if the alarm is enabled.
   Enable/disable the alarm by selecting the "AL+"/"AL-" menu option.
   When the alarm goes off, the clock plays "Frere Jacques", followed by a siren.
   The alarm can be stopped (silenced) by pressing any button.

10. Displaying reminders
   At startup and at midnight the "message.txt" file is scanned for any reminder for that new day. 
   An orange dot is displayed at the bottom during this scan.
   If a reminder is found then it will be displayed, like the quotes, for the next 24 hours.
   The message file may also contain the start and end date of the Daylight Saving Time period (DST), this will adjust the clock by 1 hour.
   The 10 personal Messages are also contained in this message file and start with [M1], [M2], [M3] etc. 
   See message.txt for more details and add your own reminders.

New features in April 2012 release:

- "DST+/DST-" settings menu will set or clear a flag that Daylight Savings Time is in effect.
  "DST+" increments the displayed hour and sets the flag.
  "DST-" decrements the displayed hour and clears the flag.
  The flag is used by the "UTC" application so UTC time is properly displayed.

- "UTC" mode now uses the DST flag.
  The saved value of the UTC offset does not change due to DST, but the calculated value will.
  The UTC offset is now specified as local time = UTC + offset, so the time in New York has a UTC offset of -5.
  The bug that prevented saving negative offsets has been fixed.

- "QUOTE" mode now allows a single quote line to be any length.  The 175 character limit has been lifted.
  Quote lines longer than 175 characters will be displayed in chunks, with no gaps between chunks.
  Special character sequences in the quote control the color used to display the rest of the line.
  <C> controls the color, where 'C' is 'R' for <R>red<G>, 'O' for <O>orange<G>, or 'G' for <G>green<G>.
  For example, < O > will display the rest of the line in orange when you remove the spaces around the 'O'.
  The line will be displayed in green if one of the above sequences is not part of the line.

- LIVED mode will show the number of days, hours, minutes, etc. lived.  Your birthday must be specified in the messages.txt file.
