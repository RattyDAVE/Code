Wise Clock 3/4 - New features in the Sept 2013 release:
- Better support for multiple displays
- "Close enough" style under "BIG" app -- slowly fills a circle for the minutes
- Common user configuration compile options are moved to "UserConf.h".
  Instead of editing WiseClock.cpp to select applications to build, edit "UserConf.h".
  Instead of editing WiseClockVer.h to select WiseClock 3 or 4, edit "UserConf.h".
  Instead of editing HT1632.h to select the number of displays, edit "UserConf.h".
- Support for Bluetooth XBee module, JY-MCU Bluetooth module, and WiFly XBee module
- PWRON setup option to select app to run when the clock starts up
- better use of the dual-screen in Countdown, Stopwatch and Score, especially when big font is selected;
- save values in Countdown and Scores when either of these apps is the default (selected in PWRON);
- added a "conventional" stopwatch mode, that accumulates the time between button presses;


Wise Clock 3/4 - New features in the June 2012 release:
Now uses a FAT32 compatible SD card library.  FAT16 and FAT32 format is supported, but not FAT12.
Can now have more than 16 files on a card, and you don't have to reformat & re-copy between editing sessions.

Not all features fit on an Atmega 644P processor (they do on an Atmega 1284P)
First choose what Apps you want to eliminate.  Copy the build tree to a safe place, then remove the
App*.cpp and App*.h files you do not want in your sketch.  For example, if you do not want the "WORDS" app,
remove the AppWords.cpp and AppWords.h files.  I suggest starting with AppWords*, AppSun*, and AppLines*.
Next edit WiseClock.cpp and comment out the #include lines that correspond to the apps you want to remove.
Proceed with building the code -- those two steps are all that are needed.
The PACMAN and DEMO apps are both contained in the WiseClock.cpp file.  If you want to remove them
from your build, edit WiseClock.h and comment out the
 #define _APP_PACMAN_H_
and/or
 #define _APP_DEMO_H_
lines.
The sketch is known to fit on an Atmega 644P processor when AppWords, AppSun, and AppLines are removed.  

- day/night "SUN" app has been added to show the location on the world where the sun is shining.
  It requires a map overlay for the display, see timewitharduino.blogspot.com/2011/05/world-day-and-night-on-wise-clock-3.html

- time at city option (+CITY/-CITY) will show the current time at up to ten different cities, cycling through each city.
  Inclusion of this option is controlled by a "#define WANT_TIME_AT_CITY" line in WiseClock.h.  The cities themselves are defined
  on the SD card, in the "message.txt" file.
  The "time at city option" requires over 200 bytes of RAM, so you may have to eliminate it on a 644P processor, especially if you
  have more than one display.

- messages on Serial1 (optional Bluetooth XBee on Wise Clock 4) can be displayed, taking the place of the
  personal messages (+MESG/-MESG).
  Inclusion of this option is controlled by a "#define SERIAL_MSG" line in WiseClock.h.

- HT1632 code has been tested with multiple displays.  When you have more than one display, edit HT1632.h and set
    #define NUM_DISPLAYS
  to the appropriate number of displays.  A 644P processor is tight on RAM, so you may need to comment out
    #define WANT_TIME_AT_CITY
  in WiseClock.h when you have more than one display.

- Alarm/chime, scroll, and apps now run asychronously from each other.  This means that when the alarm goes off, the clock
  no longer freezes.

- DEMO mode now includes the word clock, the TIX clock, and the new animations.
  BIG demo now cycles through all the BIG modes.
  UTC demo now shows graph clock rather than UTC scroll

- Animations
  It is now possible to create your own animations which are stored on the SD card.
  The APPS menu entry "ANIM" allows for continously showing one or all animations files.
  Animation files are named: anim0.wc3 - anim9.wc3.
  There are also 4 special animation files named: time00.wc3, time15.wc3, time30.wc3 and time45.wc3.
  If ANIM+ is selected in the SETUP menu and the BIG mode is active then every quarter the correponding animation is
  shown once with a random speed.
  The preprocessor directive
    #define WANT_ANIMATIONS
  in WiseClock.h controls the inclusion of the quarter-hour animations.

  Besides the 4 time??.wc3 animations there are currently 4 sample animations: anim1.wc3 - anim4.wc3.

  You may create your own animations (there is NO programming involved) by creating individual screens in EXCEL and
  then use a small conversion program to create the .wc3 file.
  As the animations are stored on the SD card you can make them as big as you like.
  For more info on creating your own animations unzip the anim.zip file which is included in this release.

- Logging
  If the "LOG+" menu is selected in the SETUP menu then the following items will be logged in the WCLOG.CSV file:
  1. Every hour the current temperature is logged both in Celsius and Fahrenheit (32.5 degrees is stored as 325)
  2. If the reset switch is pressed or power is restored after a power down situation then the "time stamp" for the
     power down and up event are logged.
  3. All entries created in the time clock (TCLOK) app are now stored in the log file.

  The WCLOG.CSV file is an ASCII Comma Seperated Values file which can be opened in Excel for further analysis
  or creating graphs etc.

  Example log file:

  TE,4,0,5,5,12,855,297 = Temperature record 85.5 Fahrenheit, 29.7 Celsius at 4:00am May 5 2012
  TE,5,0,5,5,12,850,295
  TE,6,0,5,5,12,850,295
  TE,7,0,5,5,12,850,295
  OF,7,12,5,5,12,0,0            = Powwer Off at 7:12am May 5 2012
  ON,7,18,5,5,12,0,0            = Power On   at 7:18am May 5 2012
  PI,7,20,5,5,12,1,0            = Project 1  started at 7:20am
  PO,7,30,5,5,12,1,10           = Project 1 finished at 7:30am Total time = 10 minutes
  TE,8,0,5,5,12,872,307
  TE,9,0,5,5,12,885,315

  All records in the log file have the same lay-out and contain a CR LF at the end:

  Field 1 Type of record:
      TE = Temperature
      PI = Project In
      PO = Project Out
      ON = Power On
      OF = Power Off
  Field 2
      Current Hour
  Field 3
      Current Minute
  Field 4
      Current Day
  Field 5
      Current Month^M
  Field 6
      Current Year - 2000
  Field 7
      If this is a Project record then Field 7 contains the Project Number
      If it is a Temperature record then Field 7 contains the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit multiplied by 10
  Field 8
      If this is a Project record then Field 8 contains the total Project Time in minutes
      If it is a Temperature record then Field 8 contains the temperature in degrees Celsius multiplied by 10

  The average log record is about 25 bytes long. The logging of the temperature will take 24 x 25 bytes =  600 per day.
  A 2 Megabyte log file will be full after about 9 years.

  The SETUP menu entry CLRLG allows for clearing the complete log file.

  The pre-processor directive
    #define WANT_EVENT_LOG
  controls the inclusion of the logging functions.  You may have to comment it out if you are using a 644P processor.

- TIX
  The spacing was changed on the TIX clock so blocks of the same color are easier to distinguish.
  A moving red dot around the edge was added so the display won't be totally blank at midnight.
  The red dot moves once per second, showing 0-29 left-to-right on the top of the display and
  30-59 right-to-left on the bottom of the display.

- BIG
  An additional "font" was added, showing three horizontal rows for hours, minutes, and seconds in 6-bit binary.

- WORDS
  Words mode will now cycle through the extra messages (message, date, reminder, temperature, city) in between showing the time.

- TEMP+
  The TEMP+ option under SETUP now lets you select a temperature offset.  The temperature sensor on the DS3231 chip is
  slightly warmer than ambient due to its proximity to the display electroncs.  This setting allows you to compensate for the
  temperature difference.

- NewSD
  The "NewSD" app was added, which re-initializes the SD handler.  It closes any open quote files,
  re-initializs the SD handler, re-reads the "messages.txt" file (if any), and opens the default quote file.
  This app is used when you modify the SD card and don't want to reset the clock.



Wise Clock 3/4 - New features in April 2012 release:

- Because of the large number (28) of menu entries the menu is now split in 2 loops, one for the Apps and one for the Settings.

  Apps menu loop: 
  SETUP, QUOTE, BIG, TIX, CNTDN, STOPW, SCORE, PONG, PACMN, LIVED, TCLOK, UTC, LIFE, DEMO, STATS.

  Settings menu loop: 
  APPS, ALARM, AL+/AL-, DATE+/DATE-, REMI+/REMI-, TEMP+/TEMP-, MESG+/MESG-, CHME+/CHME-, FONT+/FONT-,
  CELC/FAHR, 24H+/24H-, DST+/DST-, TIME, Y M D, DAY.

Selecting the "SETUP" menu entry will take you to the Settings menu loop, selecting the "APPS" menu entry
will take you to the Apps menu loop.

- Stopwatch: This will show the time passed by in tenths of seconds, pressing the Set key will show the 
  "lap" time.

- Count Down Timer: This timer allows for setting a time of up to 24 hours and will beep 3 times after 
  counting down to 0 seconds.

- TIX clock: Showing the time using colored squares (if you do not know what a TIX clock is, Google it!)
  The Plus key alows for changing the interval between 1, 4 and 60 seconds.

- Time Clock: This allows for recording the amount of time spent on a project. You clock "IN" at the start 
  of the project and clock "OUT" when you are finished for the day. 
  The Time clock will show the total amount of hours and minutes spent on that project over several days. 
  It allows for 5 different projects. A project may be cleared by pressing the Plus key when the "IN?" text 
  is displayed, a future version will store all "IN" and "OUT" times together with the project number in 
  an Excel compatible file on the SD card. This file may then be processed on a PC using Excel.

- New large Font: This new proportional font, selected by "FONT+/FONT-", is 14 dots high and has variable 
  width (letter i = 2 dots wide, letter m = 10 dots wide).

- The "message.txt" file now contains, 10 different personal messages, the "MESG+" menu entry allows for 
  selecting one of them (M1, M2, M3 etc.).

- The "Quotes" menu entry now let you choose from up to 10 different "Quotes" files named quot1.txt, quot2.txt
  etc. several sample files (like: Texts by Shakespeare, fake alarm system, Spanish lesson, the clock's user 
  manual (what you are reading now = "quot0.txt") are included. 
  If you select the 11th file then the "message.txt" file is displayed which shows e.g. all 10 personal 
  messages, reminders, DST etc.
  You may put your own "quote" file on the SD card, make sure that lines end with a Carriage Return and
  Linefeed character. The file must be bigger than 512 bytes.
  Special character sequences in the quote control the color used to display the rest of the line.
  <C> controls the color, where 'C' is 'R' for <R>red<G>, 'O' for <O>orange<G>, or 'G' for <G>green<G>.
  For example, < O > will display the rest of the line in orange when you remove the spaces around the 'O'.
  The line will be displayed in green if one of the above sequences is not part of the line.

- It is now possible to put characters in the non visible "video" ram and make them visible by overlaying 
  the present display in horizontal or vertical mode. When in Big Mode, press the Set Key to see a demo.

- The "UTC" mode now allows for changing the number of hours difference (+12 till -12). 
  It allows for showing the time in "Graph" (= analog clock) or "Text" mode. 
  The "Time.txt" file is no longer used and should be removed.
  The DST+/DST- setting menu entry selects if Daylight Savings Time is in effect.  DST+ will set a flag
  indicating DST is in effect, and will increment the displayed hour.  DST- will clear the flag and decrement
  the displayed hour.  The "UTC" mode will use the DST flag as an additional offset to the current time, so
  when the local time changes due to DST the displayed UTC time will not change.

- The temperature (TEMP+ menu entry) will now also show the highest and lowest temperature for that day.
 
- The brightness is now changed with the Plus Key and the scroll speed with the Set key. 
  The Set key is used in some of the new apps, but the brightness can always be changed with the Plus Key. 

- "STATS" menu: This menu entry will show the highest and lowest temperature for the current year, the last 
  time the power went off and the time when the power came back. It may take up to 24 hours before this info 
  is available.

NOTE: The filemanager for the SD card is limited, so if you want to make any change to the files on the SD 
card then format the SD card first and copy all files in one go to the SD card. Also there cannot be more 
then 16 files on the SD Card.
